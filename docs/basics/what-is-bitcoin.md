# What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.

## Key Characteristics

### Decentralized
Unlike traditional currencies controlled by central banks, Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network of computers worldwide.

### Limited Supply
Only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist, making it resistant to inflation.

### Pseudonymous
While transactions are public on the blockchain, user identities are not necessarily revealed.

### Immutable
Once recorded on the blockchain, transactions cannot be changed or reversed.

## How Bitcoin Works

1. **Transactions**: Users send and receive bitcoin through wallet applications
2. **Mining**: Network participants (miners) validate and record transactions
3. **Blockchain**: A public ledger containing all transaction history
4. **Consensus**: The network agrees on the state of the blockchain through proof-of-work
