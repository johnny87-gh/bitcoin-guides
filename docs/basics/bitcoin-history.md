# Bitcoin History

Understanding Bitcoin's history helps appreciate its revolutionary impact on money and technology.

## Origins (2008-2009)

### The Whitepaper
On October 31, 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin whitepaper titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System." This nine-page document outlined a novel solution to the double-spending problem without requiring a trusted third party.

### Genesis Block
On January 3, 2009, the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain (the genesis block) was mined. Embedded in the coinbase transaction was a reference to The Times newspaper headline: "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks."

### First Transaction
On January 12, 2009, Satoshi sent 10 BTC to Hal Finney in the first-ever Bitcoin transaction. Hal Finney was an early cryptographic pioneer and the first person (besides Satoshi) to run the Bitcoin software.

## Early Years (2010-2012)

### Pizza Day
On May 22, 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 BTC for two pizzas in the first documented real-world Bitcoin transaction. This day is now celebrated as Bitcoin Pizza Day.

### Exchanges Emerge
- July 2010: Mt. Gox launched, becoming the first major Bitcoin exchange
- Various exchanges began operating, establishing market infrastructure

### Market Cap Growth
Bitcoin's market cap grew from zero in 2009 to approximately $1 million by early 2011, attracting increasing attention from technologists, libertarians, and early adopters.

## Growth Period (2013-2017)

### First Major Price Rally
2013 saw Bitcoin's first significant mainstream attention, reaching approximately $1,000 by December.

### Institutional Interest
- 2014: Overstock.com became the first major retailer to accept Bitcoin
- 2015: Bitcoin Core development continued under new maintainers after Satoshi's departure
- 2016: Professional exchanges like Coinbase gained traction

### Scaling Debates
The block size debate intensified, leading to various proposals for scaling Bitcoin. This period saw the eventual activation of Segregated Witness (SegWit) in 2017.

## Mainstream Adoption (2018-Present)

### 2017 Bull Run
Bitcoin reached nearly $20,000 in December 2017, bringing unprecedented mainstream and media attention.

### 2020-2021 Institutional Wave
