# Bitcoin Mining

Understand Bitcoin mining from home mining to large-scale operations.

## What is Bitcoin Mining?

Bitcoin mining is the process of:
- Securing the Bitcoin network
- Verifying transactions
- Adding blocks to the blockchain
- Creating new Bitcoin
- Decentralized consensus
- Proof-of-work system

### How Mining Works

1. **Transactions**: Miners collect pending transactions
2. **Block Creation**: Transactions are compiled into a block
3. **Proof of Work**: Miners solve complex mathematical puzzles
4. **Block Validation**: First miner to solve gets to add block
5. **Reward**: Miner receives block reward + transaction fees
6. **Network Consensus**: Other nodes validate and accept block

### Why Mine Bitcoin?

- Support Bitcoin network security
- Earn Bitcoin as reward
- Potential profitability
- Understanding Bitcoin technology
- Participation in Bitcoin ecosystem
- Financial sovereignty
