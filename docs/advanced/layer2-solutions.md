## Summary

Layer 2 solutions expand Bitcoin's capabilities. Lightning for payments, Liquid for fast transfers, Stacks and RSK for smart contracts. Each has different security models and trade-offs. Understand risks and use cases.

**Best Practice**: Start with Lightning for payments. Explore other Layer 2 solutions for specific use cases. Understand that sidechain assets (L-BTC, RBTC, sBTC) are not the same as on-chain Bitcoin. Do your research before using Layer 2 solutions.

**Important**: Layer 2 solutions have different security models than Bitcoin on-chain. Understand the risks and trade-offs. Don't assume same security. Research thoroughly before committing significant funds. Use Layer 2 solutions for their specific strengths, not as long-term storage.
